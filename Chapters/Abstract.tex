\chapter*{Abstract}

The goal of the project was to create a system that supports task planning and execution, as well as enabling text communication between users. The task planning and execution support part was developed based on the Getting Things Done methodology by David Allen.

The main premise of the application was decentralization, so communication was implemented using a distributed architecture based on a Peer-to-Peer network. Data is stored using blockchain technology. Consensus is achieved through the proof of stake algorithm.

These solutions enhance the application's security because they significantly complicate data eavesdropping, impersonation, or manipulation of existing data. They also reduce the risk of data loss as there are multiple storage units. Data is transmitted via the HTTP protocol. It is also encrypted and electronically signed, which further increases security.

The application's interface was written in the QT framework, while the business logic was implemented in Python.
